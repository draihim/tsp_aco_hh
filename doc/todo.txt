2. expand a skeleton of acoalg:
    2.1.
        -make a main loop over iterations and includes all stuff that happens here (best specimen, end condition?) (Suiming / Noell)
	    -Fill out the phermone levels, and decrease them.
    2.2. getRandomTour(data.Graph g) Method  (Rudin/ Ke)
	    -Implement a method in the vertex class first named selectPath. It will use something like roulette selection to choose the path.
	    -Look up some sort of algorithm that gets us a tour/path to all thees nodes. Implement this.
