1. implement a graph class with loading stuff and other things graph - related
2. expand a skeleton of acoalg:
    2.1. make a main loop over iterations and includes all stuff that happens here (evaluation, best specimen, end condition?)
    2.2. getRandomTour(Graph g) method
    2.3 fitness function (i guess we're good with just summing the costs)
